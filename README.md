## Introduction

Text2Book is a React-based web application that allows users to convert text into Minecraft books by generating commands for command blocks. This tool is designed to simplify the process of creating in-game books with custom content for Minecraft players and mapmakers. Instead of manually entering lengthy commands, Text2Book automates the process, making it quicker and more user-friendly.

## Features
- **Text Input**: Enter the desired text content directly into the application.
- **Command Generation**: Generate the necessary commands to create the Minecraft books with the desired content.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy the generated commands to your clipboard for quick in-game implementation.

## How to Use

1. **Input Text**: On the main page, you will find a text input box where you can enter the content you want to appear in your Minecraft book.

2. **Generate Commands**: After entering desired content, click the "Generate" button. The application will process your input and generate the necessary commands to create the Minecraft book with the given content.

4. **Copy Commands**: Once the commands are generated, you will see them on the screen. Click the "Copy" button next to the commands to copy them to your clipboard.

5. **Implement in Minecraft**: Open your Minecraft world and access a command block. Paste the copied commands into the command block to create the Minecraft book. Activate the command block, and the book will be available in-game for players to read.
